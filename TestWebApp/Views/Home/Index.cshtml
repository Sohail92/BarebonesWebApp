    <h1>Proving that bootstrap works with JUMBOTRON!</h1>
</div>

<p>Below is the Bootstrap Carousel used to navigate through images.</p>
<p>This was developed in a new ASP.NET Web Application which was stripped back to have no scripts or styles. Npm was then set up and webpack installed and configured along with jquery, bootstrap and more.</p>
<p>An index.ts file was created along with an index.css file. They are both set to import the required dependencies from the node_modules folder. It's worth noting that no Nuget packages were manually installed since the creation of this project.</p>
